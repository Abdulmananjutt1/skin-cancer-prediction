**ðŸ©º Skin Cancer Detection â€“ Machine Learning Project**
This project focuses on detecting skin cancer from image data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify whether a given skin lesion image is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

**ðŸ“Œ Key Features**
**ðŸ–¼ Image-Based Detection** â€“ Works directly on skin lesion images.

**ðŸ§  Machine Learning/Deep Learning Model** â€“ Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.

**ðŸ›  Preprocessing Pipeline** â€“ Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model performance.

**ðŸ“Š Accuracy & Evaluation Metrics** â€“ Tracks accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.

**ðŸ’¡ Early Detection Support** â€“ Helps in identifying potential skin cancer cases quickly.

**ðŸ›  Methodology**
**Data Collection** â€“ Skin lesion image dataset (e.g., from ISIC dataset).

**Image Preprocessing** â€“ Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (flipping, rotation, zoom) to improve generalization.

**Model Architecture** â€“ CNN layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.

**Loss Function** â€“ Binary Cross-Entropy for classification.

Training & Validation â€“ Model trained on labeled dataset and evaluated on unseen data.

**Prediction** â€“ Outputs probability of the image being cancerous or non-cancerous.

**ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository**
skin_cancer_.py â€“ Main Python script for training and prediction.

dataset/ â€“ Folder containing example skin lesion images.

README.md â€“ Project documentation (this file).

**ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?**
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, but itâ€™s also highly treatable if detected early. This project demonstrates how AI-powered image classification can assist in medical diagnostics, potentially aiding dermatologists in early detection and treatment planning.
